START alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank END
START and of having nothing to do END
START once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading END
START but it had no pictures or conversations in it END
START and what is the use of a book END
START without pictures or conversations END
START so she was considering in her own mind END
START as well as she could END
START for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid END
START whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies END
START when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her END
START there was nothing so very remarkable in that END
START nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself END
START i shall be late END
START when she thought it over afterwards END
START it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this END
START but at the time it all seemed quite natural END
START but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket END
START and looked at it END
START and then hurried on END
START alice started to her feet END
START for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket END
START or a watch to take out of it END
START and burning with curiosity END
START she ran across the field after it END
START and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge END
START in another moment down went alice after it END
START never once considering how in the world she was to get out again END
START the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way END
START and then dipped suddenly down END
START so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well END
START either the well was very deep END
START or she fell very slowly END
START for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next END
START she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to END
START but it was too dark to see anything END
START then she looked at the sides of the well END
START and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves END
START here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs END
START she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed END
START it was labelled END
START but to her great disappointment it was empty END
START she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath END
START so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it END
START thought alice to herself END
START after such a fall as this END
START i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs END
START how brave they will all think me at home END
START i would not say anything about it END
START even if i fell off the top of the house END
START which was very likely true END
START would the fall never come to an end END
START i wonder how many miles i have fallen by this time END
START she said aloud END
START i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth END
START let me see END
START that would be four thousand miles down END
START alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom END
START and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge END
START as there was no one to listen to her END
START still it was good practice to say it over END
START that is about the right distance END
START but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i have got to END
START alice had no idea what latitude was END
START or longitude either END
START but thought they were nice grand words to say END
START presently she began again END
START i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth END
START how funny it will seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward END
START she was rather glad there was no one listening END
START as it did not sound at all the right word END
START but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is END
START is this new zealand or australia END
START and she tried to curtsey as she spoke END
START fancy curtseying as you are falling through the air END
START do you think you could manage it END
START and what an ignorant little girl she will think me for asking END
START it will never do to ask END
START perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere END
START there was nothing else to do END
START so alice soon began talking again END
START dinahll miss me very much to-night END
START i should think END
START dinah was the cat END
START i hope they will remember her saucer of milk at tea-time END
START dinah my dear END
START i wish you were down here with me END
START there are no mice in the air END
START i am afraid END
START but you might catch a bat END
START and that is very like a mouse END
START but do cats eat bats END
START and here alice began to get rather sleepy END
START and went on saying to herself END
START in a dreamy sort of way END
START do cats eat bats END
START do cats eat bats END
START do bats eat cats END
START as she could not answer either question END
START it did not much matter which way she put it END
START she felt that she was dozing off END
START and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah END
START and saying to her very earnestly END
START tell me the truth END
START did you ever eat a bat END
START down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves END
START and the fall was over END
START alice was not a bit hurt END
START and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment END
START she looked up END
START but it was all dark overhead END
START before her was another long passage END
START and the white rabbit was still in sight END
START hurrying down it END
START there was not a moment to be lost END
START away went alice like the wind END
START and was just in time to hear it say END
START as it turned a corner END
START oh my ears and whiskers END
START how late it is getting END
START she was close behind it when she turned the corner END
START but the rabbit was no longer to be seen END
START she found herself in a long END
START which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof END
START there were doors all round the hall END
START but they were all locked END
START and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other END
START trying every door END
START she walked sadly down the middle END
START wondering how she was ever to get out again END
START suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table END
START all made of solid glass END
START there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key END
START and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall END
START either the locks were too large END
START or the key was too small END
START but at any rate it would not open any of them END
START on the second time round END
START she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before END
START and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high END
START she tried the little golden key in the lock END
START and to her great delight it fitted END
START alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage END
START not much larger than a rat-hole END
START she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw END
START how she longed to get out of that dark hall END
START and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains END
START but she could not even get her head through the doorway END
START and even if my head would go through END
START thought poor alice END
START it would be of very little use without my shoulders END
START how i wish i could shut up like a telescope END
START i think i could END
START if i only knew how to begin END
START so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately END
START that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible END
START there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door END
START so she went back to the table END
START half hoping she might find another key on it END
START or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes END
START this time she found a little bottle on it END
START which certainly was not here before END
START and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label END
START with the words END
START beautifully printed on it in large letters END
START it was all very well to say END
START but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry END
START i will look first END
START and see whether it is marked â€˜poison or not END
START for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt END
START and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things END
START all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them END
START that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long END
START and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife END
START it usually bleeds END
START and she had never forgotten that END
START if you drink much from a bottle marked END
START it is almost certain to disagree with you END
START sooner or later END
START this bottle was not marked END
START so alice ventured to taste it END
START and finding it very nice END
START a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart END
START and hot buttered toast END
START she very soon finished it off END
START what a curious feeling END
START i must be shutting up like a telescope END
START and so it was indeed END
START she was now only ten inches high END
START and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden END
START she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further END
START she felt a little nervous about this END
START for it might end END
START said alice to herself END
START in my going out altogether END
START like a candle END
START i wonder what i should be like then END
START and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out END
START for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing END
START after a while END
START finding that nothing more happened END
START she decided on going into the garden at once END
START alas for poor alice END
START when she got to the door END
START she found she had forgotten the little golden key END
START and when she went back to the table for it END
START she found she could not possibly reach it END
START she could see it quite plainly through the glass END
START and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table END
START but it was too slippery END
START and when she had tired herself out with trying END
START the poor little thing sat down and cried END
START there is no use in crying like that END
START said alice to herself END
START i advise you to leave off this minute END
START she generally gave herself very good advice END
START though she very seldom followed it END
START and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes END
START and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself END
START for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people END
START but it is no use now END
START thought poor alice END
START to pretend to be two people END
START there is hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person END
START soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table END
START she opened it END
START and found in it a very small cake END
START on which the words END
START were beautifully marked in currants END
START i will eat it END
START and if it makes me grow larger END
START i can reach the key END
START and if it makes me grow smaller END
START i can creep under the door END
START so either way i will get into the garden END
START and i do not care which happens END
START she ate a little bit END
START and said anxiously to herself END
START holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing END
START and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size END
START to be sure END
START this generally happens when one eats cake END
START but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen END
START that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way END
START so she set to work END
START and very soon finished off the cake END
START curiouser and curiouser END
START she was so much surprised END
START that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english END
START now i am opening out like the largest telescope that ever was END
START for when she looked down at her feet END
START they seemed to be almost out of sight END
START they were getting so far off END
START my poor little feet END
START i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now END
START i am sure i shall not be able END
START i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you END
START you must manage the best way you can END
START but i must be kind to them END
START or perhaps they will not walk the way i want to go END
START let me see END
START i will give them a new pair of boots every christmas END
START and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it END
START they must go by the carrier END
START and how funny it will seem END
START sending presents to ones own feet END
START and how odd the directions will look END
START alices right foot END
START near the fender END
START with alices love END
START what nonsense i am talking END
START just then her head struck against the roof of the hall END
START in fact she was now more than nine feet high END
START and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door END
START it was as much as she could do END
START lying down on one side END
START to look through into the garden with one eye END
START but to get through was more hopeless than ever END
START she sat down and began to cry again END
START you ought to be ashamed of yourself END
START a great girl like you END
START she might well say this END
START to go on crying in this way END
START stop this moment END
START i tell you END
START but she went on all the same END
START shedding gallons of tears END
START until there was a large pool all round her END
START about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall END
START after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance END
START and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming END
START it was the white rabbit returning END
START with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other END
START he came trotting along in a great hurry END
START muttering to himself as he came END
START will not she be savage if i have kept her waiting END
START alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one END
START when the rabbit came near her END
START in a low END
START if you please END
START the rabbit started violently END
START dropped the white kid gloves and the fan END
START and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go END
START alice took up the fan and gloves END
START as the hall was very hot END
START she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking END
START how queer everything is to-day END
START and yesterday things went on just as usual END
START i wonder if i have been changed in the night END
START let me think END
START was i the same when i got up this morning END
START i almost think i can remember feeling a little different END
START but if i am not the same END
START the next question is END
START who in the world am i END
START that is the great puzzle END
START and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself END
START to see if she could have been changed for any of them END
START i am sure i am not ada END
START for her hair goes in such long ringlets END
START and mine does not go in ringlets at all END
START and i am sure i cannot be mabel END
START for i know all sorts of things END
START she knows such a very little END
START she is she END
START and i am i END
START how puzzling it all is END
START i will try if i know all the things i used to know END
START let me see END
START four times five is twelve END
START and four times six is thirteen END
START and four times seven is END
START i shall never get to twenty at that rate END
START the multiplication table does not signify END
START lets try geography END
START london is the capital of paris END
START and paris is the capital of rome END
START that is all wrong END
START i am certain END
START i must have been changed for mabel END
START i will try and say â€˜how doth the little END
START and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons END
START and began to repeat it END
START but her voice sounded hoarse and strange END
START and the words did not come the same as they used to do END
START how doth the little crocodile END
START improve his shining tail END
START and pour the waters of the nile END
START on every golden scale END
START how cheerfully he seems to grin END
START how neatly spread his claws END
START and welcome little fishes in END
START with gently smiling jaws END
START i am sure those are not the right words END
START said poor alice END
START and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on END
START i must be mabel after all END
START and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house END
START and have next to no toys to play with END
START ever so many lessons to learn END
START i have made up my mind about it END
START if i am mabel END
START i will stay down here END
START it will be no use their putting their heads down and saying â€˜come up again END
START i shall only look up and say â€˜who am i then END
START tell me that first END
START if i like being that person END
START i will come up END
START i will stay down here till i am somebody else END
START with a sudden burst of tears END
START i do wish they would put their heads down END
START i am so very tired of being all alone here END
START as she said this she looked down at her hands END
START and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit is little white kid gloves while she was talking END
START how can i have done that END
START i must be growing small again END
START she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it END
START and found that END
START as nearly as she could guess END
START she was now about two feet high END
START and was going on shrinking rapidly END
START she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding END
START and she dropped it hastily END
START just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether END
START that was a narrow escape END
START a good deal frightened at the sudden change END
START but very glad to find herself still in existence END
START and now for the garden END
START and she ran with all speed back to the little door END
START the little door was shut again END
START and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before END
START and things are worse than ever END
START thought the poor child END
START for i never was so small as this before END
START and i declare it is too bad END
START that it is END
START as she said these words her foot slipped END
START and in another moment END
START she was up to her chin in salt water END
START her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea END
START and in that case i can go back by railway END
START she said to herself END
START alice had been to the seaside once in her life END
START and had come to the general conclusion END
START that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea END
START some children digging in the sand with wooden spades END
START then a row of lodging houses END
START and behind them a railway station END
START she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high END
START i wish i had not cried so much END
START as she swam about END
START trying to find her way out END
START i shall be punished for it now END
START by being drowned in my own tears END
START that will be a queer thing END
START to be sure END
START everything is queer to-day END
START just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off END
START and she swam nearer to make out what it was END
START at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus END
START but then she remembered how small she was now END
START and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself END
START would it be of any use END
START to speak to this mouse END
START everything is so out-of-the-way down here END
START that i should think very likely it can talk END
START at any rate END
START there is no harm in trying END
START so she began END
START do you know the way out of this pool END
START i am very tired of swimming about here END
START alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse END
START she had never done such a thing before END
START but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar END
START of a mouse END
START to a mouse END
START the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively END
START and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes END
START but it said nothing END
START perhaps it does not understand english END
START i daresay it is a french mouse END
START come over with william the conqueror END
START with all her knowledge of history END
START alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened END
START so she began again END
START oÃ¹ est ma chatte END
START which was the first sentence in her french lesson-book END
START the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water END
START and seemed to quiver all over with fright END
START i beg your pardon END
START cried alice hastily END
START afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings END
START i quite forgot you did not like cats END
START not like cats END
START cried the mouse END
START in a shrill END
START would you like cats if you were me END
START said alice in a soothing tone END
START do not be angry about it END
START and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah END
START i think you would take a fancy to cats if you could only see her END
START she is such a dear quiet thing END
START alice went on END
START half to herself END
START as she swam lazily about in the pool END
START and she sits purring so nicely by the fire END
START licking her paws and washing her face END
START and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse END
START and she is such a capital one for catching mice END
START i beg your pardon END
START cried alice again END
START for this time the mouse was bristling all over END
START and she felt certain it must be really offended END
START we will not talk about her any more if you would rather not END
START cried the mouse END
START who was trembling down to the end of his tail END
START as if i would talk on such a subject END
START our family always hated cats END
START do not let me hear the name again END
START i will not indeed END
START in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation END
START are you fond END
START the mouse did not answer END
START so alice went on eagerly END
START there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you END
START a little bright-eyed terrier END
START such long curly brown hair END
START and it will fetch things when you throw them END
START and it will sit up and beg for its dinner END
START and all sorts of things END
START i cannot remember half of them END
START and it belongs to a farmer END
START and he says it is so useful END
START it is worth a hundred pounds END
START he says it kills all the rats and END
START cried alice in a sorrowful tone END
START i am afraid i have offended it again END
START for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go END
START and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went END
START so she called softly after it END
START do come back again END
START and we will not talk about cats or dogs either END
START if you do not like them END
START when the mouse heard this END
START it turned round and swam slowly back to her END
START its face was quite pale END
START and it said in a low trembling voice END
START let us get to the shore END
START and then i will tell you my history END
START and you will understand why it is i hate cats and dogs END
START it was high time to go END
START for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it END
START there were a duck and a dodo END
START a lory and an eaglet END
START and several other curious creatures END
START alice led the way END
START and the whole party swam to the shore END
START they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank END
START the birds with draggled feathers END
START the animals with their fur clinging close to them END
START and all dripping wet END
START the first question of course was END
START how to get dry again END
START they had a consultation about this END
START and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them END
START as if she had known them all her life END
START she had quite a long argument with the lory END
START who at last turned sulky END
START and would only say END
START i am older than you END
START and must know better END
START and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was END
START as the lory positively refused to tell its age END
START there was no more to be said END
START at last the mouse END
START who seemed to be a person of authority among them END
START all of you END
START and listen to me END
START i will soon make you dry enough END
START they all sat down at once END
START in a large ring END
START with the mouse in the middle END
START alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it END
START for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon END
START said the mouse with an important air END
START are you all ready END
START this is the driest thing i know END
START silence all round END
START if you please END
START â€˜william the conqueror END
START whose cause was favoured by the pope END
START was soon submitted to by the english END
START who wanted leaders END
START and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest END
START edwin and morcar END
START the earls of mercia and northumbria END
START said the lory END
START with a shiver END
START i beg your pardon END
START said the mouse END
START but very politely END
START did you speak END
START said the lory hastily END
START i thought you did END
START said the mouse END
START â€˜edwin and morcar END
START the earls of mercia and northumbria END
START declared for him END
START and even stigand END
START the patriotic archbishop of canterbury END
START found it advisable END
START said the duck END
START the mouse replied rather crossly END
START of course you know what â€˜it means END
START i know what â€˜it means well enough END
START when i find a thing END
START said the duck END
START it is generally a frog or a worm END
START the question is END
START what did the archbishop find END
START the mouse did not notice this question END
START but hurriedly went on END
START found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown END
START williams conduct at first was moderate END
START but the insolence of his normans END
START how are you getting on now END
START turning to alice as it spoke END
START as wet as ever END
START said alice in a melancholy tone END
START it does not seem to dry me at all END
START in that case END
START said the dodo solemnly END
START rising to its feet END
START i move that the meeting adjourn END
START for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies END
START said the eaglet END
START i do not know the meaning of half those long words END
START what is more END
START i do not believe you do either END
START and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile END
START some of the other birds tittered audibly END
START what i was going to say END
START said the dodo in an offended tone END
START that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race END
START what is a caucus-race END
START not that she wanted much to know END
START but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak END
START and no one else seemed inclined to say anything END
START said the dodo END
START the best way to explain it is to do it END
START as you might like to try the thing yourself END
START some winter day END
START i will tell you how the dodo managed it END
START first it marked out a race-course END
START in a sort of circle END
START the exact shape does not matter END
START and then all the party were placed along the course END
START here and there END
START there was no END
START but they began running when they liked END
START and left off when they liked END
START so that it was not easy to know when the race was over END
START when they had been running half an hour or so END
START and were quite dry again END
START the dodo suddenly called out END
START the race is over END
START and they all crowded round it END
START but who has won END
START this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought END
START and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead END
START the position in which you usually see shakespeare END
START in the pictures of him END
START while the rest waited in silence END
START at last the dodo said END
START everybody has won END
START and all must have prizes END
START but who is to give the prizes END
START quite a chorus of voices asked END
START said the dodo END
START pointing to alice with one finger END
START and the whole party at once crowded round her END
START calling out in a confused way END
START alice had no idea what to do END
START and in despair she put her hand in her pocket END
START and pulled out a box of comfits END
START luckily the salt water had not got into it END
START and handed them round as prizes END
START there was exactly one a-piece END
START but she must have a prize herself END
START said the mouse END
START the dodo replied very gravely END
START what else have you got in your pocket END
START he went on END
START turning to alice END
START only a thimble END
START said alice sadly END
START hand it over here END
START said the dodo END
START then they all crowded round her once more END
START while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble END
START we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble END
START when it had finished this short speech END
START they all cheered END
START alice thought the whole thing very absurd END
START but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh END
START as she could not think of anything to say END
START she simply bowed END
START and took the thimble END
START looking as solemn as she could END
START the next thing was to eat the comfits END
START this caused some noise and confusion END
START as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs END
START and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back END
START it was over at last END
START and they sat down again in a ring END
START and begged the mouse to tell them something more END
START you promised to tell me your history END
START and why it is you hate END
START c and d END
START she added in a whisper END
START half afraid that it would be offended again END
START mine is a long and a sad tale END
START said the mouse END
START turning to alice END
START it is a long tail END
START looking down with wonder at the mouses tail END
START but why do you call it sad END
START and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking END
START so that her idea of the tale was something like this END
START fury said to a END
START met in the END
START both go to END
START i will take no END
START must have a END
START morning i have END
START mouse to the END
START â€˜i will be END
START you are not attending END
START said the mouse to alice severely END
START what are you thinking of END
START i beg your pardon END
START said alice very humbly END
START you had got to the fifth bend END
START i had not END
START cried the mouse END
START sharply and very angrily END
START always ready to make herself useful END
START and looking anxiously about her END
START do let me help to undo it END
START i shall do nothing of the sort END
START said the mouse END
START getting up and walking away END
START you insult me by talking such nonsense END
START i did not mean it END
START pleaded poor alice END
START but you are so easily offended END
START the mouse only growled in reply END
START please come back and finish your story END
START alice called after it END
START and the others all joined in chorus END
START but the mouse only shook its head impatiently END
START and walked a little quicker END
START what a pity it would not stay END
START sighed the lory END
START as soon as it was quite out of sight END
START and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter END
START let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper END
START hold your tongue END
START said the young crab END
START a little snappishly END
START you are enough to try the patience of an oyster END
START i wish i had our dinah here END
START i know i do END
START said alice aloud END
START addressing nobody in particular END
START she would soon fetch it back END
START and who is dinah END
START if i might venture to ask the question END
START said the lory END
START alice replied eagerly END
START for she was always ready to talk about her pet END
START dinahs our cat END
START and she is such a capital one for catching mice you cannot think END
START i wish you could see her after the birds END
START she will eat a little bird as soon as look at it END
START this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party END
START some of the birds hurried off at once END
START one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully END
START i really must be getting home END
START the night-air does not suit my throat END
START and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children END
START it is high time you were all in bed END
START on various pretexts they all moved off END
START and alice was soon left alone END
START i wish i had not mentioned dinah END
START she said to herself in a melancholy tone END
START nobody seems to like her END
START and i am sure she is the best cat in the world END
START my dear dinah END
START i wonder if i shall ever see you any more END
START and here poor alice began to cry again END
START for she felt very lonely and low-spirited END
START in a little while END
START she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance END
START and she looked up eagerly END
START half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind END
START and was coming back to finish his story END
START it was the white rabbit END
START trotting slowly back again END
START and looking anxiously about as it went END
START as if it had lost something END
START and she heard it muttering to itself END
START oh my dear paws END
START oh my fur and whiskers END
START she will get me executed END
START as sure as ferrets are ferrets END
START where can i have dropped them END
START alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves END
START and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them END
START but they were nowhere to be seen END
START everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool END
START and the great hall END
START with the glass table and the little door END
START had vanished completely END
START very soon the rabbit noticed alice END
START as she went hunting about END
START and called out to her in an angry tone END
START what are you doing out here END
START run home this moment END
START and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan END
START and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to END
START without trying to explain the mistake it had made END
START he took me for his housemaid END
START she said to herself as she ran END
START how surprised he will be when he finds out who i am END
START but i would better take him his fan and gloves END
START if i can find them END
START as she said this END
START she came upon a neat little house END
START on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name END
START engraved upon it END
START she went in without knocking END
START and hurried upstairs END
START in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann END
START and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves END
START how queer it seems END
START alice said to herself END
START to be going messages for a rabbit END
START i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next END
START and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen END
START come here directly END
START and get ready for your walk END
START â€˜coming in a minute END
START but i have got to see that the mouse does not get out END
START only i do not think END
START alice went on END
START that they would let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that END
START by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window END
START and on it END
START as she had hoped END
START a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves END
START she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves END
START and was just going to leave the room END
START when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass END
START there was no label this time with the words END
START but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips END
START i know something interesting is sure to happen END
START she said to herself END
START whenever i eat or drink anything END
START so i will just see what this bottle does END
START i do hope it will make me grow large again END
START for really i am quite tired of being such a tiny little thing END
START it did so indeed END
START and much sooner than she had expected END
START before she had drunk half the bottle END
START she found her head pressing against the ceiling END
START and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken END
START she hastily put down the bottle END
START saying to herself END
START that is quite enough END
START i hope i shall not grow any more END
START as it is END
START i cannot get out at the door END
START i do wish i had not drunk quite so much END
START it was too late to wish that END
START she went on growing END
START and very soon had to kneel down on the floor END
START in another minute there was not even room for this END
START and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door END
START and the other arm curled round her head END
START still she went on growing END
START as a last resource END
START she put one arm out of the window END
START and one foot up the chimney END
START and said to herself END
START now i can do no more END
START what will become of me END
START luckily for alice END
START the little magic bottle had now had its full effect END
START and she grew no larger END
START still it was very uncomfortable END
START as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again END
START no wonder she felt unhappy END
START it was much pleasanter at home END
START thought poor alice END
START when one was not always growing larger and smaller END
START and being ordered about by mice and rabbits END
START i almost wish i had not gone down that rabbit-hole END
START it is rather curious END
START this sort of life END
START i do wonder what can have happened to me END
START when i used to read fairy-tales END
START i fancied that kind of thing never happened END
START and now here i am in the middle of one END
START there ought to be a book written about me END
START that there ought END
START and when i grow up END
START i will write one END
START but i am grown up now END
START she added in a sorrowful tone END
START at least there is no room to grow up any more here END
START shall i never get any older than i am now END
START that will be a comfort END
START never to be an old woman END
START always to have lessons to learn END
START i should not like that END
START you foolish alice END
START she answered herself END
START how can you learn lessons in here END
START there is hardly room for you END
START and no room at all for any lesson-books END
START and so she went on END
START taking first one side and then the other END
START and making quite a conversation of it altogether END
START but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside END
START and stopped to listen END
START said the voice END
START fetch me my gloves this moment END
START then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs END
START alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her END
START and she trembled till she shook the house END
START quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit END
START and had no reason to be afraid of it END
START presently the rabbit came up to the door END
START and tried to open it END
START as the door opened inwards END
START and alices elbow was pressed hard against it END
START that attempt proved a failure END
START alice heard it say to itself END
START then i will go round and get in at the window END
START that you will not END
START after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window END
START she suddenly spread out her hand END
START and made a snatch in the air END
START she did not get hold of anything END
START but she heard a little shriek and a fall END
START and a crash of broken glass END
START from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame END
START or something of the sort END
START next came an angry voice END
START the rabbit is END
START where are you END
START and then a voice she had never heard before END
START sure then i am here END
START digging for apples END
START digging for apples END
START said the rabbit angrily END
START come and help me out of this END
START sounds of more broken glass END
START now tell me END
START what is that in the window END
START it is an arm END
START he pronounced it END
START who ever saw one that size END
START it fills the whole window END
START but it is an arm for all that END
START it is got no business there END
START at any rate END
START go and take it away END
START there was a long silence after this END
START and alice could only hear whispers now and then END
START i do not like it END
START do as i tell you END
START and at last she spread out her hand again END
START and made another snatch in the air END
START this time there were two little shrieks END
START and more sounds of broken glass END
START what a number of cucumber-frames there must be END
START i wonder what they will do next END
START as for pulling me out of the window END
START i only wish they could END
START i am sure i do not want to stay in here any longer END
START she waited for some time without hearing anything more END
START at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels END
START and the sound of a good many voices all talking together END
START she made out the words END
START where is the other ladder END
START i had not to bring but one END
START bills got the other END
START fetch it here END
START put em up at this corner END
START tie em together first END
START they do not reach half high enough yet END
START they will do well enough END
START do not be particular END
START catch hold of this rope END
START will the roof bear END
START mind that loose slate END
START it is coming down END
START a loud crash END
START who did that END
START it was bill END
START who is to go down the chimney END
START i shall not END
START you do it END
START that i will not END
START bills to go down END
START the master says you are to go down the chimney END
START so bills got to come down the chimney END
START said alice to herself END
START they seem to put everything upon bill END
START i would not be in bills place for a good deal END
START this fireplace is narrow END
START to be sure END
START but i think i can kick a little END
START she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could END
START and waited till she heard a little animal END
START she could not guess of what sort it was END
START scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her END
START saying to herself END
START this is bill END
START she gave one sharp kick END
START and waited to see what would happen next END
START the first thing she heard was a general chorus of END
START there goes bill END
START then the rabbit is voice along END
START you by the hedge END
START and then another confusion of voices END
START hold up his head END
START do not choke him END
START how was it END
START what happened to you END
START tell us all about it END
START last came a little feeble END
START that is bill END
START i hardly know END
START i am better now END
START but i am a deal too flustered to tell you END
START all i know is END
START something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box END
START and up i goes like a sky-rocket END
START so you did END
START said the others END
START we must burn the house down END
START said the rabbit is voice END
START and alice called out as loud as she could END
START if you do END
START i will set dinah at you END
START there was a dead silence instantly END
START and alice thought to herself END
START i wonder what they will do next END
START if they had any sense END
START they would take the roof off END
START after a minute or two END
START they began moving about again END
START and alice heard the rabbit say END
START a barrowful will do END
START to begin with END
START a barrowful of what END
START but she had not long to doubt END
START for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window END
START and some of them hit her in the face END
START i will put a stop to this END
START she said to herself END
START and shouted out END
START you would better not do that again END
START which produced another dead silence END
START alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor END
START and a bright idea came into her head END
START if i eat one of these cakes END
START it is sure to make some change in my size END
START and as it cannot possibly make me larger END
START it must make me smaller END
START so she swallowed one of the cakes END
START and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly END
START as soon as she was small enough to get through the door END
START she ran out of the house END
START and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside END
START the poor little lizard END
START was in the middle END
START being held up by two guinea-pigs END
START who were giving it something out of a bottle END
START they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared END
START but she ran off as hard as she could END
START and soon found herself safe in a thick wood END
START the first thing i have got to do END
START said alice to herself END
START as she wandered about in the wood END
START is to grow to my right size again END
START and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden END
START i think that will be the best plan END
START it sounded an excellent plan END
START and very neatly and simply arranged END
START the only difficulty was END
START that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it END
START and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees END
START a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry END
START an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes END
START and feebly stretching out one paw END
START trying to touch her END
START poor little thing END
START in a coaxing tone END
START and she tried hard to whistle to it END
START but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry END
START in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing END
START hardly knowing what she did END
START she picked up a little bit of stick END
START and held it out to the puppy END
START whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once END
START with a yelp of delight END
START and rushed at the stick END
START and made believe to worry it END
START then alice dodged behind a great thistle END
START to keep herself from being run over END
START and the moment she appeared on the other side END
START the puppy made another rush at the stick END
START and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it END
START thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse END
START and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet END
START ran round the thistle again END
START then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick END
START running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back END
START and barking hoarsely all the while END
START till at last it sat down a good way off END
START with its tongue hanging out of its mouth END
START and its great eyes half shut END
START this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape END
START so she set off at once END
START and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath END
START and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance END
START and yet what a dear little puppy it was END
START as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself END
START and fanned herself with one of the leaves END
START i should have liked teaching it tricks very much END
START if i would only been the right size to do it END
START i would nearly forgotten that i have got to grow up again END
START let me see END
START how is it to be managed END
START i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other END
START but the great question is END
START the great question certainly was END
START alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass END
START but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances END
START there was a large mushroom growing near her END
START about the same height as herself END
START and when she had looked under it END
START and on both sides of it END
START and behind it END
START it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it END
START she stretched herself up on tiptoe END
START and peeped over the edge of the mushroom END
START and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar END
START that was sitting on the top with its arms folded END
START quietly smoking a long hookah END
START and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else END
START the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence END
START at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth END
START and addressed her in a languid END
START who are you END
START said the caterpillar END
START this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation END
START i hardly know END
START just at present END
START at least i know who i was when i got up this morning END
START but i think i must have been changed several times since then END
START what do you mean by that END
START said the caterpillar sternly END
START i cannot explain myself END
START i am afraid END
START because i am not myself END
START i do not see END
START said the caterpillar END
START i am afraid i cannot put it more clearly END
START alice replied very politely END
START for i cannot understand it myself to begin with END
START and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing END
START it is not END
START said the caterpillar END
START perhaps you have not found it so yet END
START but when you have to turn into a chrysalis END
START you will some day END
START and then after that into a butterfly END
START i should think you will feel it a little queer END
START will not you END
START not a bit END
START said the caterpillar END
START perhaps your feelings may be different END
START all i know is END
START it would feel very queer to me END
START said the caterpillar contemptuously END
START who are you END
START which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation END
START alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks END
START and she drew herself up and said END
START you ought to tell me who you are END
START said the caterpillar END
START here was another puzzling question END
START and as alice could not think of any good reason END
START and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind END
START she turned away END
START the caterpillar called after her END
START i have something important to say END
START this sounded promising END
START alice turned and came back again END
START keep your temper END
START said the caterpillar END
START is that all END
START swallowing down her anger as well as she could END
START said the caterpillar END
START alice thought she might as well wait END
START as she had nothing else to do END
START and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing END
START for some minutes it puffed away without speaking END
START but at last it unfolded its arms END
START took the hookah out of its mouth again END
START so you think you are changed END
START i am afraid i am END
START i cannot remember things as i used END
START and i do not keep the same size for ten minutes together END
START cannot remember what things END
START said the caterpillar END
START i have tried to say END
START how doth the little busy bee END
START but it all came different END
START alice replied in a very melancholy voice END
START you are old END
START said the caterpillar END
START alice folded her hands END
START you are old END
START the young man said END
START and your hair has become very white END
START and yet you incessantly stand on your head END
START do you think END
START at your age END
START it is right END
START in my youth END
START father william replied to his son END
START i feared it might injure the brain END
START now that i am perfectly sure i have none END
START i do it again and again END
START you are old END
START said the youth END
START as i mentioned before END
START and have grown most uncommonly fat END
START yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door END
START what is the reason of that END
START in my youth END
START said the sage END
START as he shook his grey locks END
START i kept all my limbs very supple END
START by the use of this ointment END
START one shilling the box END
START allow me to sell you a couple END
START you are old END
START said the youth END
START and your jaws are too weak END
START for anything tougher than suet END
START yet you finished the goose END
START with the bones and the beak END
START how did you manage to do it END
START in my youth END
START said his father END
START i took to the law END
START and argued each case with my wife END
START and the muscular strength END
START which it gave to my jaw END
START has lasted the rest of my life END
START you are old END
START said the youth END
START one would hardly suppose END
START that your eye was as steady as ever END
START yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose END
START what made you so awfully clever END
START i have answered three questions END
START and that is enough END
START said his father END
START do not give yourself airs END
START do you think i can listen all day to such stuff END
START or i will kick you down stairs END
START that is not said right END
START said the caterpillar END
START not quite right END
START i am afraid END
START some of the words have got altered END
START it is wrong from beginning to end END
START said the caterpillar decidedly END
START and there was silence for some minutes END
START the caterpillar was the first to speak END
START what size do you want to be END
START i am not particular as to size END
START alice hastily replied END
START only one does not like changing so often END
START i do not know END
START said the caterpillar END
START alice said nothing END
START she had never been so much contradicted in her life before END
START and she felt that she was losing her temper END
START are you content now END
START said the caterpillar END
START i should like to be a little larger END
START if you would not mind END
START three inches is such a wretched height to be END
START it is a very good height indeed END
START said the caterpillar angrily END
START rearing itself upright as it spoke END
START it was exactly three inches high END
START but i am not used to it END
START pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone END
START and she thought of herself END
START i wish the creatures would not be so easily offended END
START you will get used to it in time END
START said the caterpillar END
START and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again END
START this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again END
START in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice END
START and shook itself END
START then it got down off the mushroom END
START and crawled away in the grass END
START merely remarking as it went END
START one side will make you grow taller END
START and the other side will make you grow shorter END
START one side of what END
START the other side of what END
START thought alice to herself END
START of the mushroom END
START said the caterpillar END
START just as if she had asked it aloud END
START and in another moment it was out of sight END
START alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute END
START trying to make out which were the two sides of it END
START and as it was perfectly round END
START she found this a very difficult question END
START at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go END
START and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand END
START and now which is which END
START she said to herself END
START and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect END
START the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin END
START it had struck her foot END
START she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change END
START but she felt that there was no time to be lost END
START as she was shrinking rapidly END
START so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit END
START her chin was pressed so closely against her foot END
START that there was hardly room to open her mouth END
START but she did it at last END
START and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit END
START * * * * * * * END
START * * * * * * END
START * * * * * * * END
START my heads free at last END
START said alice in a tone of delight END
START which changed into alarm in another moment END
START when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found END
START all she could see END
START when she looked down END
START was an immense length of neck END
START which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her END
START what can all that green stuff be END
START and where have my shoulders got to END
START my poor hands END
START how is it i cannot see you END
START she was moving them about as she spoke END
START but no result seemed to follow END
START except a little shaking among the distant green leaves END
START as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head END
START she tried to get her head down to them END
START and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction END
START like a serpent END
START she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag END
START and was going to dive in among the leaves END
START which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering END
START when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry END
START a large pigeon had flown into her face END
START and was beating her violently with its wings END
START screamed the pigeon END
START i am not a serpent END
START said alice indignantly END
START let me alone END
START i say again END
START repeated the pigeon END
START but in a more subdued tone END
START and added with a kind of sob END
START i have tried every way END
START and nothing seems to suit them END
START i have not the least idea what you are talking about END
START i have tried the roots of trees END
START and i have tried banks END
START and i have tried hedges END
START the pigeon went on END
START without attending to her END
START but those serpents END
START there is no pleasing them END
START alice was more and more puzzled END
START but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished END
START as if it was not trouble enough hatching the eggs END
START said the pigeon END
START but i must be on the look-out for serpents night and day END
START i have not had a wink of sleep these three weeks END
START i am very sorry you have been annoyed END
START who was beginning to see its meaning END
START and just as i would taken the highest tree in the wood END
START continued the pigeon END
START raising its voice to a shriek END
START and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last END
START they must needs come wriggling down from the sky END
START but i am not a serpent END
START i tell you END
START i am a END
START i am a END
START what are you END
START said the pigeon END
START i can see you are trying to invent something END
START i am a little girl END
START as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day END
START a likely story indeed END
START said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt END
START i have seen a good many little girls in my time END
START but never one with such a neck as that END
START you are a serpent END
START and there is no use denying it END
START i suppose you will be telling me next that you never tasted an egg END
START i have tasted eggs END
START who was a very truthful child END
START but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do END
START i do not believe it END
START said the pigeon END
START but if they do END
START why then they are a kind of serpent END
START that is all i can say END
START this was such a new idea to alice END
START that she was quite silent for a minute or two END
START which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding END
START you are looking for eggs END
START i know that well enough END
START and what does it matter to me whether you are a little girl or a serpent END
START it matters a good deal to me END
START said alice hastily END
START but i am not looking for eggs END
START as it happens END
START and if i was END
START i should not want yours END
START i do not like them raw END
START said the pigeon in a sulky tone END
START as it settled down again into its nest END
START alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could END
START for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches END
START and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it END
START after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands END
START and she set to work very carefully END
START nibbling first at one and then at the other END
START and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter END
START until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height END
START it was so long since she had been anything near the right size END
START that it felt quite strange at first END
START but she got used to it in a few minutes END
START and began talking to herself END
START there is half my plan done now END
START how puzzling all these changes are END
START i am never sure what i am going to be END
START from one minute to another END
START i have got back to my right size END
START the next thing is END
START to get into that beautiful garden END
START how is that to be done END
START as she said this END
START she came suddenly upon an open place END
START with a little house in it about four feet high END
START whoever lives there END
START it will never do to come upon them this size END
START i should frighten them out of their wits END
START so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again END
START and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high END
START for a minute or two she stood looking at the house END
START and wondering what to do next END
START when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood END
START she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery END
START judging by his face only END
START she would have called him a fish END
START and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles END
START it was opened by another footman in livery END
START with a round face END
START and large eyes like a frog END
START and both footmen END
START had powdered hair that curled all over their heads END
START she felt very curious to know what it was all about END
START and crept a little way out of the wood to listen END
START the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter END
START nearly as large as himself END
START and this he handed over to the other END
START in a solemn tone END
START for the duchess END
START an invitation from the queen to play croquet END
START the frog-footman repeated END
START in the same solemn tone END
START only changing the order of the words a little END
START from the queen END
START an invitation for the duchess to play croquet END
START then they both bowed low END
START and their curls got entangled together END
START alice laughed so much at this END
START that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her END
START and when she next peeped out the fish-footman was gone END
START and the other was sitting on the ground near the door END
START staring stupidly up into the sky END
START alice went timidly up to the door END
START there is no sort of use in knocking END
START said the footman END
START and that for two reasons END
START because i am on the same side of the door as you are END
START because they are making such a noise inside END
START no one could possibly hear you END
START and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within END
START a constant howling and sneezing END
START and every now and then a great crash END
START as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces END
START how am i to get in END
START there might be some sense in your knocking END
START the footman went on without attending to her END
START if we had the door between us END
START if you were inside END
START you might knock END
START and i could let you out END
START he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking END
START and this alice thought decidedly uncivil END
START but perhaps he cannot help it END
START she said to herself END
START his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head END
START but at any rate he might answer questions END
START how am i to get in END
START i shall sit here END
START the footman remarked END
START at this moment the door of the house opened END
START and a large plate came skimming out END
START straight at the footmans head END
START it just grazed his nose END
START and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him END
START or next day END
START the footman continued in the same tone END
START exactly as if nothing had happened END
START how am i to get in END
START asked alice again END
START in a louder tone END
START are you to get in at all END
START said the footman END
START that is the first question END
START only alice did not like to be told so END
START it is really dreadful END
START she muttered to herself END
START the way all the creatures argue END
START it is enough to drive one crazy END
START the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark END
START i shall sit here END
START on and off END
START for days and days END
START but what am i to do END
START anything you like END
START said the footman END
START and began whistling END
START there is no use in talking to him END
START said alice desperately END
START he is perfectly idiotic END
START and she opened the door and went in END
START the door led right into a large kitchen END
START which was full of smoke from one end to the other END
START the duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle END
START nursing a baby END
START the cook was leaning over the fire END
START stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup END
START there is certainly too much pepper in that soup END
START alice said to herself END
START as well as she could for sneezing END
START there was certainly too much of it in the air END
START even the duchess sneezed occasionally END
START and as for the baby END
START it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause END
START the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze END
START were the cook END
START and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear END
START please would you tell me END
START a little timidly END
START for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first END
START why your cat grins like that END
START it is a cheshire cat END
START said the duchess END
START and that is why END
START she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped END
START but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby END
START and not to her END
START so she took courage END
START and went on again END
START i did not know that cheshire cats always grinned END
START i did not know that cats could grin END
START they all can END
START said the duchess END
START and most of em do END
START i do not know of any that do END
START alice said very politely END
START feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation END
START you do not know much END
START said the duchess END
START and that is a fact END
START alice did not at all like the tone of this remark END
START and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation END
START while she was trying to fix on one END
START the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire END
START and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby END
START the fire-irons came first END
START then followed a shower of saucepans END
START the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her END
START and the baby was howling so much already END
START that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not END
START please mind what you are doing END
START jumping up and down in an agony of terror END
START there goes his precious nose END
START as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it END
START and very nearly carried it off END
START if everybody minded their own business END
START the duchess said in a hoarse growl END
START the world would go round a deal faster than it does END
START which would not be an advantage END
START who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge END
START just think of what work it would make with the day and night END
START you see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis END
START talking of axes END
START said the duchess END
START chop off her head END
START alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook END
START to see if she meant to take the hint END
START but the cook was busily stirring the soup END
START and seemed not to be listening END
START so she went on again END
START or is it twelve END
START do not bother me END
START said the duchess END
START i never could abide figures END
START and with that she began nursing her child again END
START singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so END
START and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line END
START speak roughly to your little boy END
START and beat him when he sneezes END
START he only does it to annoy END
START because he knows it teases END
START in which the cook and the baby joined END
START while the duchess sang the second verse of the song END
START she kept tossing the baby violently up and down END
START and the poor little thing howled so END
START that alice could hardly hear the words END
START i speak severely to my boy END
START i beat him when he sneezes END
START for he can thoroughly enjoy END
START the pepper when he pleases END
START you may nurse it a bit END
START if you like END
START the duchess said to alice END
START flinging the baby at her as she spoke END
START i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen END
START and she hurried out of the room END
START the cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out END
START but it just missed her END
START alice caught the baby with some difficulty END
START as it was a queer-shaped little creature END
START and held out its arms and legs in all directions END
START just like a star-fish END
START the poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it END
START and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again END
START so that altogether END
START for the first minute or two END
START it was as much as she could do to hold it END
START as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it END
START which was to twist it up into a sort of knot END
START and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot END
START so as to prevent its undoing itself END
START she carried it out into the open air END
START if i do not take this child away with me END
START they are sure to kill it in a day or two END
START would not it be murder to leave it behind END
START she said the last words out loud END
START and the little thing grunted in reply END
START it had left off sneezing by this time END
START do not grunt END
START that is not at all a proper way of expressing yourself END
START the baby grunted again END
START and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it END
START there could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose END
START much more like a snout than a real nose END
START also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby END
START altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all END
START but perhaps it was only sobbing END
START and looked into its eyes again END
START to see if there were any tears END
START there were no tears END
START if you are going to turn into a pig END
START i will have nothing more to do with you END
START the poor little thing sobbed again END
START it was impossible to say which END
START and they went on for some while in silence END
START alice was just beginning to think to herself END
START what am i to do with this creature when i get it home END
START when it grunted again END
START that she looked down into its face in some alarm END
START this time there could be no mistake about it END
START it was neither more nor less than a pig END
START and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further END
START so she set the little creature down END
START and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood END
START if it had grown up END
START she said to herself END
START it would have made a dreadfully ugly child END
START but it makes rather a handsome pig END
START and she began thinking over other children she knew END
START who might do very well as pigs END
START and was just saying to herself END
START if one only knew the right way to change them END
START when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off END
START the cat only grinned when it saw alice END
START it looked good-natured END
START still it had very long claws and a great many teeth END
START so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect END
START as she did not at all know whether it would like the name END
START it only grinned a little wider END
START it is pleased so far END
START and she went on END
START would you tell me END
START which way i ought to go from here END
START that depends a good deal on where you want to get to END
START said the cat END
START i do not much care where END
START then it does not matter which way you go END
START said the cat END
START so long as i get somewhere END
START alice added as an explanation END
START you are sure to do that END
START said the cat END
START if you only walk long enough END
START alice felt that this could not be denied END
START so she tried another question END
START what sort of people live about here END
START in that direction END
START the cat said END
START waving its right paw round END
START lives a hatter END
START and in that direction END
START waving the other paw END
START lives a march hare END
START visit either you like END
START they are both mad END
START but i do not want to go among mad people END
START you cannot help that END
START said the cat END
START we are all mad here END
START i am mad END
START you are mad END
START how do you know i am mad END
START you must be END
START said the cat END
START or you would not have come here END
START alice did not think that proved it at all END
START she went on END
START and how do you know that you are mad END
START to begin with END
START said the cat END
START a dogs not mad END
START you grant that END
START i suppose so END
START the cat went on END
START a dog growls when it is angry END
START and wags its tail when it is pleased END
START now i growl when i am pleased END
START and wag my tail when i am angry END
START therefore i am mad END
START i call it purring END
START call it what you like END
START said the cat END
START do you play croquet with the queen to-day END
START i should like it very much END
START but i have not been invited yet END
START you will see me there END
START said the cat END
START alice was not much surprised at this END
START she was getting so used to queer things happening END
START while she was looking at the place where it had been END
START it suddenly appeared again END
START what became of the baby END
START said the cat END
START i would nearly forgotten to ask END
START it turned into a pig END
START alice quietly said END
START just as if it had come back in a natural way END
START i thought it would END
START said the cat END
START and vanished again END
START alice waited a little END
START half expecting to see it again END
START but it did not appear END
START and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live END
START i have seen hatters before END
START she said to herself END
START the march hare will be much the most interesting END
START and perhaps as this is may it will not be raving mad END
START at least not so mad as it was in march END
START as she said this END
START she looked up END
START and there was the cat again END
START sitting on a branch of a tree END
START did you say pig END
START said the cat END
START i said pig END
START and i wish you would not keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly END
START you make one quite giddy END
START said the cat END
START and this time it vanished quite slowly END
START beginning with the end of the tail END
START and ending with the grin END
START which remained some time after the rest of it had gone END
START i have often seen a cat without a grin END
START but a grin without a cat END
START it is the most curious thing i ever saw in my life END
START she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare END
START she thought it must be the right house END
START because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur END
START it was so large a house END
START that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom END
START and raised herself to about two feet high END
START even then she walked up towards it rather timidly END
START saying to herself END
START suppose it should be raving mad after all END
START i almost wish i would gone to see the hatter instead END
START there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house END
START and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it END
START a dormouse was sitting between them END
START and the other two were using it as a cushion END
START resting their elbows on it END
START and talking over its head END
START very uncomfortable for the dormouse END
START as it is asleep END
START i suppose it does not mind END
START the table was a large one END
START but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it END
START they cried out when they saw alice coming END
START there is plenty of room END
START said alice indignantly END
START and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table END
START have some wine END
START the march hare said in an encouraging tone END
START alice looked all round the table END
START but there was nothing on it but tea END
START i do not see any wine END
START there is not any END
START said the march hare END
START then it was not very civil of you to offer it END
START said alice angrily END
START it was not very civil of you to sit down without being invited END
START said the march hare END
START i did not know it was your table END
START it is laid for a great many more than three END
START your hair wants cutting END
START said the hatter END
START he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity END
START and this was his first speech END
START you should learn not to make personal remarks END
START alice said with some severity END
START it is very rude END
START the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this END
START but all he said was END
START why is a raven like a writing-desk END
START we shall have some fun now END
START i am glad they have begun asking riddles END
START i believe i can guess that END
START she added aloud END
START do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it END
START said the march hare END
START then you should say what you mean END
START the march hare went on END
START alice hastily replied END
START at least i mean what i say END
START that is the same thing END
START not the same thing a bit END
START said the hatter END
START you might just as well say that â€˜i see what i eat is the same thing as â€˜i eat what i see END
START you might just as well say END
START added the march hare END
START that â€˜i like what i get is the same thing as â€˜i get what i like END
START you might just as well say END
START added the dormouse END
START who seemed to be talking in his sleep END
START that â€˜i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as â€˜i sleep when i breathe END
START it is the same thing with you END
START said the hatter END
START and here the conversation dropped END
START and the party sat silent for a minute END
START while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks END
START which was not much END
START the hatter was the first to break the silence END
START what day of the month is it END
START turning to alice END
START he had taken his watch out of his pocket END
START and was looking at it uneasily END
START shaking it every now and then END
START and holding it to his ear END
START alice considered a little END
START and then said END
START two days wrong END
START sighed the hatter END
START i told you butter would not suit the works END
START he added looking angrily at the march hare END
START it was the best butter END
START the march hare meekly replied END
START but some crumbs must have got in as well END
START the hatter grumbled END
START you should not have put it in with the bread-knife END
START the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily END
START then he dipped it into his cup of tea END
START and looked at it again END
START but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark END
START it was the best butter END
START alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity END
START what a funny watch END
START it tells the day of the month END
START and does not tell what oclock it is END
START why should it END
START muttered the hatter END
START does your watch tell you what year it is END
START of course not END
START alice replied very readily END
START but that is because it stays the same year for such a long time together END
START which is just the case with mine END
START said the hatter END
START alice felt dreadfully puzzled END
START the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it END
START and yet it was certainly english END
START i do not quite understand you END
START as politely as she could END
START the dormouse is asleep again END
START said the hatter END
START and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose END
START the dormouse shook its head impatiently END
START without opening its eyes END
START just what i was going to remark myself END
START have you guessed the riddle yet END
START the hatter said END
START turning to alice again END
START i give it up END
START what is the answer END
START i have not the slightest idea END
START said the hatter END
START said the march hare END
START alice sighed wearily END
START i think you might do something better with the time END
START than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers END
START if you knew time as well as i do END
START said the hatter END
START you would not talk about wasting it END
START it is him END
START i do not know what you mean END
START of course you do not END
START the hatter said END
START tossing his head contemptuously END
START i dare say you never even spoke to time END
START alice cautiously replied END
START but i know i have to beat time when i learn music END
START that accounts for it END
START said the hatter END
START he will not stand beating END
START if you only kept on good terms with him END
START he would do almost anything you liked with the clock END
START suppose it were nine oclock in the morning END
START just time to begin lessons END
START you would only have to whisper a hint to time END
START and round goes the clock in a twinkling END
START time for dinner END
START i only wish it was END
START the march hare said to itself in a whisper END
START that would be grand END
START said alice thoughtfully END
START i should not be hungry for it END
START not at first END
START said the hatter END
START but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked END
START is that the way you manage END
START the hatter shook his head mournfully END
START we quarrelled last march END
START just before he went mad END
START pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare END
START it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts END
START and i had to sing END
START how i wonder what you are at END
START you know the song END
START i have heard something like it END
START it goes on END
START the hatter continued END
START in this way END
START â€˜up above the world you fly END
START like a tea-tray in the sky END
START here the dormouse shook itself END
START and began singing in its sleep END
START and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop END
START i would hardly finished the first verse END
START said the hatter END
START when the queen jumped up and bawled out END
START â€˜he is murdering the time END
START off with his head END
START how dreadfully savage END
START and ever since that END
START the hatter went on in a mournful tone END
START he will not do a thing i ask END
START it is always six oclock now END
START a bright idea came into alices head END
START is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here END
START that is it END
START said the hatter with a sigh END
START it is always tea-time END
START and we have no time to wash the things between whiles END
START then you keep moving round END
START said the hatter END
START as the things get used up END
START but what happens when you come to the beginning again END
START alice ventured to ask END
START suppose we change the subject END
START the march hare interrupted END
START i am getting tired of this END
START i vote the young lady tells us a story END
START i am afraid i do not know one END
START rather alarmed at the proposal END
START then the dormouse shall END
START they both cried END
START and they pinched it on both sides at once END
START the dormouse slowly opened his eyes END
START i was not asleep END
START he said in a hoarse END
START i heard every word you fellows were saying END
START tell us a story END
START said the march hare END
START and be quick about it END
START added the hatter END
START or you will be asleep again before it is done END
START once upon a time there were three little sisters END
START the dormouse began in a great hurry END
START and their names were elsie END
START and they lived at the bottom of a well END
START what did they live on END
START who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking END
START they lived on treacle END
START said the dormouse END
START after thinking a minute or two END
START they could not have done that END
START alice gently remarked END
START they would have been ill END
START so they were END
START said the dormouse END
START alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like END
START but it puzzled her too much END
START so she went on END
START but why did they live at the bottom of a well END
START take some more tea END
START the march hare said to alice END
START i have had nothing yet END
START alice replied in an offended tone END
START so i cannot take more END
START you mean you cannot take less END
START said the hatter END
START it is very easy to take more than nothing END
START nobody asked your opinion END
START who is making personal remarks now END
START the hatter asked triumphantly END
START alice did not quite know what to say to this END
START so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter END
START and then turned to the dormouse END
START and repeated her question END
START why did they live at the bottom of a well END
START the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it END
START and then said END
START it was a treacle-well END
START there is no such thing END
START alice was beginning very angrily END
START but the hatter and the march hare went END
START and the dormouse sulkily remarked END
START if you cannot be civil END
START you would better finish the story for yourself END
START please go on END
START alice said very humbly END
START i will not interrupt again END
START i dare say there may be one END
START said the dormouse indignantly END
START he consented to go on END
START and so these three little sisters END
START they were learning to draw END
START what did they draw END
START quite forgetting her promise END
START said the dormouse END
START without considering at all this time END
START i want a clean cup END
START interrupted the hatter END
START lets all move one place on END
START he moved on as he spoke END
START and the dormouse followed him END
START the march hare moved into the dormouses place END
START and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare END
START the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change END
START and alice was a good deal worse off than before END
START as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate END
START alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again END
START so she began very cautiously END
START but i do not understand END
START where did they draw the treacle from END
START you can draw water out of a water-well END
START said the hatter END
START so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well END
START but they were in the well END
START alice said to the dormouse END
START not choosing to notice this last remark END
START of course they were END
START said the dormouse END
START this answer so confused poor alice END
START that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it END
START they were learning to draw END
START the dormouse went on END
START yawning and rubbing its eyes END
START for it was getting very sleepy END
START and they drew all manner of things END
START everything that begins with an m END
START why with an m END
START said the march hare END
START alice was silent END
START the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time END
START and was going off into a doze END
START on being pinched by the hatter END
START it woke up again with a little shriek END
START and went on END
START that begins with an m END
START such as mouse-traps END
START and the moon END
START you know you say things are END
START much of a muchness END
START did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness END
START now you ask me END
START very much confused END
START i do not think END
START then you should not talk END
START said the hatter END
START this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear END
START she got up in great disgust END
START and walked off END
START the dormouse fell asleep instantly END
START and neither of the others took the least notice of her going END
START though she looked back once or twice END
START half hoping that they would call after her END
START the last time she saw them END
START they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot END
START at any rate i will never go there again END
START said alice as she picked her way through the wood END
START it is the stupidest tea-party i ever was at in all my life END
START just as she said this END
START she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it END
START that is very curious END
START but everythings curious today END
START i think i may as well go in at once END
START and in she went END
START once more she found herself in the long hall END
START and close to the little glass table END
START i will manage better this time END
START she said to herself END
START and began by taking the little golden key END
START and unlocking the door that led into the garden END
START then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom END
START she had kept a piece of it in her pocket END
START till she was about a foot high END
START then she walked down the little passage END
START she found herself at last in the beautiful garden END
START among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains END
START a large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden END
START the roses growing on it were white END
START but there were three gardeners at it END
START busily painting them red END
START alice thought this a very curious thing END
START and she went nearer to watch them END
START and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say END
START look out now END
START do not go splashing paint over me like that END
START i could not help it END
START in a sulky tone END
START seven jogged my elbow END
START on which seven looked up and said END
START that is right END
START always lay the blame on others END
START you would better not talk END
START i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded END
START said the one who had spoken first END
START that is none of your business END
START it is his business END
START and i will tell him END
START it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions END
START seven flung down his brush END
START and had just begun END
START of all the unjust things END
START when his eye chanced to fall upon alice END
START as she stood watching them END
START and he checked himself suddenly END
START the others looked round also END
START and all of them bowed low END
START would you tell me END
START a little timidly END
START why you are painting those roses END
START five and seven said nothing END
START but looked at two END
START two began in a low voice END
START why the fact is END
START this here ought to have been a red rose-tree END
START and we put a white one in by mistake END
START and if the queen was to find it out END
START we should all have our heads cut off END
START so you see END
START we are doing our best END
START afore she comes END
START at this moment five END
START who had been anxiously looking across the garden END
START and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces END
START there was a sound of many footsteps END
START and alice looked round END
START eager to see the queen END
START first came ten soldiers carrying clubs END
START these were all shaped like the three gardeners END
START oblong and flat END
START with their hands and feet at the corners END
START next the ten courtiers END
START these were ornamented all over with diamonds END
START and walked two and two END
START as the soldiers did END
START after these came the royal children END
START there were ten of them END
START and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand END
START they were all ornamented with hearts END
START next came the guests END
START mostly kings and queens END
START and among them alice recognised the white rabbit END
START it was talking in a hurried nervous manner END
START smiling at everything that was said END
START and went by without noticing her END
START then followed the knave of hearts END
START carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion END
START last of all this grand procession END
START came the king and queen of hearts END
START alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners END
START but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions END
START what would be the use of a procession END
START if people had all to lie down upon their faces END
START so that they could not see it END
START so she stood still where she was END
START when the procession came opposite to alice END
START they all stopped and looked at her END
START and the queen said severely END
START who is this END
START she said it to the knave of hearts END
START who only bowed and smiled in reply END
START said the queen END
START tossing her head impatiently END
START turning to alice END
START she went on END
START what is your name END
START my name is alice END
START so please your majesty END
START said alice very politely END
START but she added END
START they are only a pack of cards END
START i need not be afraid of them END
START and who are these END
START said the queen END
START pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree END
START as they were lying on their faces END
START and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack END
START she could not tell whether they were gardeners END
START or three of her own children END
START how should i know END
START surprised at her own courage END
START it is no business of mine END
START the queen turned crimson with fury END
START after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast END
START off with her head END
START very loudly and decidedly END
START and the queen was silent END
START the king laid his hand upon her arm END
START and timidly said END
START she is only a child END
START the queen turned angrily away from him END
START and said to the knave END
START turn them over END
START the knave did so END
START with one foot END
START said the queen END
START in a shrill END
START and the three gardeners instantly jumped up END
START and began bowing to the king END
START the royal children END
START and everybody else END
START leave off that END
START screamed the queen END
START you make me giddy END
START turning to the rose-tree END
START she went on END
START what have you been doing here END
START may it please your majesty END
START in a very humble tone END
START going down on one knee as he spoke END
START we were trying END
START said the queen END
START who had meanwhile been examining the roses END
START off with their heads END
START and the procession moved on END
START three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners END
START who ran to alice for protection END
START you shall not be beheaded END
START and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near END
START the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two END
START looking for them END
START and then quietly marched off after the others END
START are their heads off END
START shouted the queen END
START their heads are gone END
START if it please your majesty END
START the soldiers shouted in reply END
START that is right END
START shouted the queen END
START can you play croquet END
START the soldiers were silent END
START and looked at alice END
START as the question was evidently meant for her END
START roared the queen END
START and alice joined the procession END
START wondering very much what would happen next END
START it is a very fine day END
START said a timid voice at her side END
START she was walking by the white rabbit END
START who was peeping anxiously into her face END
START where is the duchess END
START said the rabbit in a low END
START he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke END
START and then raised himself upon tiptoe END
START put his mouth close to her ear END
START she is under sentence of execution END
START did you say â€˜what a pity END
START the rabbit asked END
START i did not END
START i do not think it is at all a pity END
START i said â€˜what for END
START she boxed the queens ears END
START the rabbit began END
START alice gave a little scream of laughter END
START the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone END
START the queen will hear you END
START she came rather late END
START and the queen said END
START get to your places END
START shouted the queen in a voice of thunder END
START and people began running about in all directions END
START tumbling up against each other END
START they got settled down in a minute or two END
START and the game began END
START alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life END
START it was all ridges and furrows END
START the balls were live hedgehogs END
START the mallets live flamingoes END
START and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet END
START to make the arches END
START the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo END
START she succeeded in getting its body tucked away END
START under her arm END
START with its legs hanging down END
START just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out END
START and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head END
START it would twist itself round and look up in her face END
START with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing END
START and when she had got its head down END
START and was going to begin again END
START it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself END
START and was in the act of crawling away END
START besides all this END
START there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to END
START as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground END
START alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed END
START the players all played at once without waiting for turns END
START quarrelling all the while END
START and fighting for the hedgehogs END
START and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion END
START and went stamping about END
START off with his head END
START off with her head END
START about once in a minute END
START alice began to feel very uneasy END
START to be sure END
START she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen END
START but she knew that it might happen any minute END
START what would become of me END
START they are dreadfully fond of beheading people here END
START the great wonder is END
START that there is any one left alive END
START she was looking about for some way of escape END
START and wondering whether she could get away without being seen END
START when she noticed a curious appearance in the air END
START it puzzled her very much at first END
START after watching it a minute or two END
START she made it out to be a grin END
START and she said to herself END
START it is the cheshire cat END
START now i shall have somebody to talk to END
START how are you getting on END
START said the cat END
START as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with END
START alice waited till the eyes appeared END
START and then nodded END
START it is no use speaking to it END
START till its ears have come END
START or at least one of them END
START in another minute the whole head appeared END
START and then alice put down her flamingo END
START and began an account of the game END
START feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her END
START the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight END
START and no more of it appeared END
START i do not think they play at all fairly END
START in rather a complaining tone END
START and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cannot hear oneself speak END
START and they do not seem to have any rules in particular END
START if there are END
START nobody attends to them END
START and you have no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive END
START there is the arch i have got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground END
START and i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now END
START only it ran away when it saw mine coming END
START how do you like the queen END
START said the cat in a low voice END
START not at all END
START she is so extremely END
START just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her END
START so she went on END
START likely to win END
START that it is hardly worth while finishing the game END
START the queen smiled and passed on END
START who are you talking to END
START said the king END
START going up to alice END
START and looking at the cats head with great curiosity END
START it is a friend of mine END
START a cheshire cat END
START allow me to introduce it END
START i do not like the look of it at all END
START said the king END
START it may kiss my hand if it likes END
START i would rather not END
START the cat remarked END
START do not be impertinent END
START said the king END
START and do not look at me like that END
START he got behind alice as he spoke END
START a cat may look at a king END
START i have read that in some book END
START but i do not remember where END
START it must be removed END
START said the king very decidedly END
START and he called the queen END
START who was passing at the moment END
START i wish you would have this cat removed END
START the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties END
START great or small END
START off with his head END
START without even looking round END
START i will fetch the executioner myself END
START said the king eagerly END
START and he hurried off END
START alice thought she might as well go back END
START and see how the game was going on END
START as she heard the queens voice in the distance END
START screaming with passion END
START she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns END
START and she did not like the look of things at all END
START as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not END
START so she went in search of her hedgehog END
START the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog END
START which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other END
START the only difficulty was END
START that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden END
START where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree END
START by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back END
START the fight was over END
START and both the hedgehogs were out of sight END
START but it does not matter much END
START as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground END
START so she tucked it away under her arm END
START that it might not escape again END
START and went back for a little more conversation with her friend END
START when she got back to the cheshire cat END
START she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it END
START there was a dispute going on between the executioner END
START and the queen END
START who were all talking at once END
START while all the rest were quite silent END
START and looked very uncomfortable END
START the moment alice appeared END
START she was appealed to by all three to settle the question END
START and they repeated their arguments to her END
START as they all spoke at once END
START she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said END
START the executioners argument was END
START that you could not cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from END
START that he had never had to do such a thing before END
START and he was not going to begin at his time of life END
START the kings argument was END
START that anything that had a head could be beheaded END
START and that you were not to talk nonsense END
START the queens argument was END
START that if something was not done about it in less than no time she would have everybody executed END
START it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious END
START alice could think of nothing else to say but END
START it belongs to the duchess END
START you would better ask her about it END
START she is in prison END
START the queen said to the executioner END
START fetch her here END
START and the executioner went off like an arrow END
START the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone END
START by the time he had come back with the duchess END
START it had entirely disappeared END
START so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it END
START while the rest of the party went back to the game END
START you cannot think how glad i am to see you again END
START you dear old thing END
START said the duchess END
START as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices END
START and they walked off together END
START alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper END
START and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen END
START when i am a duchess END
START she said to herself END
START not in a very hopeful tone though END
START i will not have any pepper in my kitchen at all END
START soup does very well without END
START maybe it is always pepper that makes people hot-tempered END
START she went on END
START very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule END
START and vinegar that makes them sour END
START and camomile that makes them bitter END
START and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered END
START i only wish people knew that END
START then they would not be so stingy about it END
START she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time END
START and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear END
START you are thinking about something END
START and that makes you forget to talk END
START i cannot tell you just now what the moral of that is END
START but i shall remember it in a bit END
START perhaps it has not one END
START alice ventured to remark END
START said the duchess END
START everythings got a moral END
START if only you can find it END
START and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke END
START alice did not much like keeping so close to her END
START because the duchess was very ugly END
START because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder END
START and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin END
START she did not like to be rude END
START so she bore it as well as she could END
START the games going on rather better now END
START by way of keeping up the conversation a little END
START said the duchess END
START and the moral of that is END
START that makes the world go round END
START that it is done by everybody minding their own business END
START it means much the same thing END
START said the duchess END
START digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added END
START and the moral of that is END
START â€˜take care of the sense END
START and the sounds will take care of themselves END
START how fond she is of finding morals in things END
START alice thought to herself END
START i dare say you are wondering why i do not put my arm round your waist END
START the duchess said after a pause END
START the reason is END
START that i am doubtful about the temper of your flamingo END
START shall i try the experiment END
START he might bite END
START alice cautiously replied END
START not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried END
START said the duchess END
START flamingoes and mustard both bite END
START and the moral of that is END
START â€˜birds of a feather flock together END
START only mustard is not a bird END
START said the duchess END
START what a clear way you have of putting things END
START it is a mineral END
START of course it is END
START said the duchess END
START who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said END
START there is a large mustard-mine near here END
START and the moral of that is END
START â€˜the more there is of mine END
START the less there is of yours END
START who had not attended to this last remark END
START it is a vegetable END
START it does not look like one END
START but it is END
START i quite agree with you END
START said the duchess END
START and the moral of that is END
START â€˜be what you would seem to be END
START or if you would like it put more simply END
START â€˜never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise END
START i think i should understand that better END
START alice said very politely END
START if i had it written down END
START but i cannot quite follow it as you say it END
START that is nothing to what i could say if i chose END
START the duchess replied END
START in a pleased tone END
START pray do not trouble yourself to say it any longer than that END
START do not talk about trouble END
START said the duchess END
START i make you a present of everything i have said as yet END
START a cheap sort of present END
START i am glad they do not give birthday presents like that END
START but she did not venture to say it out loud END
START the duchess asked END
START with another dig of her sharp little chin END
START i have a right to think END
START said alice sharply END
START for she was beginning to feel a little worried END
START just about as much right END
START said the duchess END
START as pigs have to fly END
START and the m END
START to alices great surprise END
START the duchesss voice died away END
START even in the middle of her favourite word â€˜moral END
START and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble END
START alice looked up END
START and there stood the queen in front of them END
START with her arms folded END
START frowning like a thunderstorm END
START a fine day END
START the duchess began in a low END
START i give you fair warning END
START shouted the queen END
START stamping on the ground as she spoke END
START either you or your head must be off END
START and that in about half no time END
START take your choice END
START the duchess took her choice END
START and was gone in a moment END
START lets go on with the game END
START the queen said to alice END
START and alice was too much frightened to say a word END
START but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground END
START the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence END
START and were resting in the shade END
START the moment they saw her END
START they hurried back to the game END
START the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives END
START all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players END
START off with his head END
START off with her head END
START those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers END
START who of course had to leave off being arches to do this END
START so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left END
START and all the players END
START except the king END
START were in custody and under sentence of execution END
START then the queen left off END
START quite out of breath END
START and said to alice END
START have you seen the mock turtle yet END
START i do not even know what a mock turtle is END
START it is the thing mock turtle soup is made from END
START said the queen END
START i never saw one END
START or heard of one END
START said the queen END
START and he shall tell you his history END
START as they walked off together END
START alice heard the king say in a low voice END
START to the company generally END
START you are all pardoned END
START that is a good thing END
START she said to herself END
START for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered END
START they very soon came upon a gryphon END
START lying fast asleep in the sun END
START if you do not know what a gryphon is END
START look at the picture END
START said the queen END
START and take this young lady to see the mock turtle END
START and to hear his history END
START i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered END
START and she walked off END
START leaving alice alone with the gryphon END
START alice did not quite like the look of the creature END
START but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen END
START so she waited END
START the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes END
START then it watched the queen till she was out of sight END
START then it chuckled END
START said the gryphon END
START half to itself END
START half to alice END
START what is the fun END
START said the gryphon END
START it is all her fancy END
START they never executes nobody END
START everybody says â€˜come on END
START as she went slowly after it END
START i never was so ordered about in all my life END
START they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance END
START sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock END
START as they came nearer END
START alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break END
START she pitied him deeply END
START what is his sorrow END
START she asked the gryphon END
START and the gryphon answered END
START very nearly in the same words as before END
START it is all his fancy END
START he has not got no sorrow END
START so they went up to the mock turtle END
START who looked at them with large eyes full of tears END
START but said nothing END
START this here young lady END
START said the gryphon END
START she wants for to know your history END
START i will tell it her END
START said the mock turtle in a deep END
START both of you END
START and do not speak a word till i have finished END
START so they sat down END
START and nobody spoke for some minutes END
START alice thought to herself END
START i do not see how he can ever finish END
START if he does not begin END
START but she waited patiently END
START said the mock turtle at last END
START with a deep sigh END
START i was a real turtle END
START these words were followed by a very long silence END
START broken only by an occasional exclamation of END
START from the gryphon END
START and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle END
START alice was very nearly getting up and saying END
START for your interesting story END
START but she could not help thinking there must be more to come END
START so she sat still and said nothing END
START when we were little END
START the mock turtle went on at last END
START though still sobbing a little now and then END
START we went to school in the sea END
START the master was an old turtle END
START we used to call him tortoise END
START why did you call him tortoise END
START if he was not one END
START we called him tortoise because he taught us END
START said the mock turtle angrily END
START really you are very dull END
START you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question END
START added the gryphon END
START and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice END
START who felt ready to sink into the earth END
START at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle END
START do not be all day about it END
START and he went on in these words END
START we went to school in the sea END
START though you may not believe it END
START i never said i did not END
START said the mock turtle END
START hold your tongue END
START added the gryphon END
START before alice could speak again END
START the mock turtle went on END
START we had the best of educations END
START we went to school every day END
START i have been to a day-school END
START you need not be so proud as all that END
START asked the mock turtle a little anxiously END
START we learned french and music END
START said the mock turtle END
START said alice indignantly END
START then yours was not a really good school END
START said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief END
START now at ours they had at the end of the bill END
START you could not have wanted it much END
START living at the bottom of the sea END
START i could not afford to learn it END
START said the mock turtle with a sigh END
START i only took the regular course END
START what was that END
START reeling and writhing END
START to begin with END
START the mock turtle replied END
START and then the different branches of arithmetic END
START i never heard of â€˜uglification END
START alice ventured to say END
START what is it END
START the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise END
START never heard of uglifying END
START you know what to beautify is END
START said alice doubtfully END
START the gryphon went on END
START if you do not know what to uglify is END
START you are a simpleton END
START alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it END
START so she turned to the mock turtle END
START what else had you to learn END
START there was mystery END
START the mock turtle replied END
START counting off the subjects on his flappers END
START ancient and modern END
START the drawling-master was an old conger-eel END
START that used to come once a week END
START he taught us drawling END
START and fainting in coils END
START what was that like END
START i cannot show it you myself END
START the mock turtle said END
START i am too stiff END
START and the gryphon never learnt it END
START had not time END
START said the gryphon END
START i went to the classics master END
START he was an old crab END
START i never went to him END
START the mock turtle said with a sigh END
START he taught laughing and grief END
START they used to say END
START so he did END
START so he did END
START said the gryphon END
START sighing in his turn END
START and both creatures hid their faces in their paws END
START and how many hours a day did you do lessons END
START in a hurry to change the subject END
START ten hours the first day END
START said the mock turtle END
START nine the next END
START and so on END
START what a curious plan END
START that is the reason they are called lessons END
START the gryphon remarked END
START because they lessen from day to day END
START this was quite a new idea to alice END
START and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark END
START then the eleventh day must have been a holiday END
START of course it was END
START said the mock turtle END
START and how did you manage on the twelfth END
START alice went on eagerly END
START that is enough about lessons END
START the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone END
START tell her something about the games now END
START the mock turtle sighed deeply END
START and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes END
START he looked at alice END
START and tried to speak END
START but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice END
START same as if he had a bone in his throat END
START said the gryphon END
START and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back END
START at last the mock turtle recovered his voice END
START with tears running down his cheeks END
START he went on again END
START you may not have lived much under the sea END
START i have not END
START and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster END
START alice began to say END
START i once tasted END
START but checked herself hastily END
START so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is END
START what sort of a dance is it END
START said the gryphon END
START you first form into a line along the sea-shore END
START cried the mock turtle END
START and so on END
START when you have cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way END
START that generally takes some time END
START interrupted the gryphon END
START you advance twice END
START each with a lobster as a partner END
START cried the gryphon END
START the mock turtle said END
START set to partners END
START and retire in same order END
START continued the gryphon END
START the mock turtle went on END
START you throw the END
START shouted the gryphon END
START with a bound into the air END
START as far out to sea as you can END
START swim after them END
START screamed the gryphon END
START turn a somersault in the sea END
START cried the mock turtle END
START capering wildly about END
START change lobsters again END
START yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice END
START back to land again END
START and that is all the first figure END
START said the mock turtle END
START suddenly dropping his voice END
START and the two creatures END
START who had been jumping about like mad things all this time END
START sat down again very sadly and quietly END
START and looked at alice END
START it must be a very pretty dance END
START said alice timidly END
START would you like to see a little of it END
START said the mock turtle END
START very much indeed END
START lets try the first figure END
START said the mock turtle to the gryphon END
START we can do without lobsters END
START which shall sing END
START said the gryphon END
START i have forgotten the words END
START so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice END
START every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close END
START and waving their forepaws to mark the time END
START while the mock turtle sang this END
START very slowly and sadly END
START will you walk a little faster END
START said a whiting to a snail END
START there is a porpoise close behind us END
START and he is treading on my tail END
START see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance END
START they are waiting on the shingle END
START will you come and join the dance END
START will not you END
START will not you END
START will you join the dance END
START will not you END
START will not you END
START will not you join the dance END
START you can really have no notion how delightful it will be END
START when they take us up and throw us END
START with the lobsters END
START out to sea END
START but the snail replied END
START and gave a look askance END
START said he thanked the whiting kindly END
START but he would not join the dance END
START would not join the dance END
START could not join the dance END
START what matters it how far we go END
START his scaly friend replied END
START there is another shore END
START upon the other side END
START the further off from england the nearer is to france END
START then turn not pale END
START but come and join the dance END
START will not you END
START will not you END
START will you join the dance END
START will not you END
START will not you END
START will not you join the dance END
START it is a very interesting dance to watch END
START feeling very glad that it was over at last END
START and i do so like that curious song about the whiting END
START as to the whiting END
START said the mock turtle END
START you have seen them END
START i have often seen them at dinn END
START she checked herself hastily END
START i do not know where dinn may be END
START said the mock turtle END
START but if you have seen them so often END
START of course you know what they are like END
START i believe so END
START alice replied thoughtfully END
START they have their tails in their mouths END
START and they are all over crumbs END
START you are wrong about the crumbs END
START said the mock turtle END
START crumbs would all wash off in the sea END
START but they have their tails in their mouths END
START and the reason is END
START here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes END
START tell her about the reason and all that END
START he said to the gryphon END
START the reason is END
START said the gryphon END
START that they would go with the lobsters to the dance END
START so they got thrown out to sea END
START so they had to fall a long way END
START so they got their tails fast in their mouths END
START so they could not get them out again END
START that is all END
START it is very interesting END
START i never knew so much about a whiting before END
START i can tell you more than that END
START if you like END
START said the gryphon END
START do you know why it is called a whiting END
START i never thought about it END
START it does the boots and shoes END
START the gryphon replied very solemnly END
START alice was thoroughly puzzled END
START does the boots and shoes END
START she repeated in a wondering tone END
START what are your shoes done with END
START said the gryphon END
START what makes them so shiny END
START alice looked down at them END
START and considered a little before she gave her answer END
START they are done with blacking END
START boots and shoes under the sea END
START the gryphon went on in a deep voice END
START are done with a whiting END
START now you know END
START and what are they made of END
START alice asked in a tone of great curiosity END
START soles and eels END
START the gryphon replied rather impatiently END
START any shrimp could have told you that END
START if i would been the whiting END
START whose thoughts were still running on the song END
START i would have said to the porpoise END
START we do not want you with us END
START they were obliged to have him with them END
START the mock turtle said END
START no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise END
START would not it really END
START said alice in a tone of great surprise END
START of course not END
START said the mock turtle END
START if a fish came to me END
START and told me he was going a journey END
START i should say â€˜with what porpoise END
START do not you mean â€˜purpose END
START i mean what i say END
START the mock turtle replied in an offended tone END
START and the gryphon added END
START lets hear some of your adventures END
START i could tell you my adventures END
START beginning from this morning END
START said alice a little timidly END
START but it is no use going back to yesterday END
START because i was a different person then END
START explain all that END
START said the mock turtle END
START the adventures first END
START said the gryphon in an impatient tone END
START explanations take such a dreadful time END
START so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit END
START she was a little nervous about it just at first END
START the two creatures got so close to her END
START one on each side END
START and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide END
START but she gained courage as she went on END
START her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating END
START you are old END
START to the caterpillar END
START and the words all coming different END
START and then the mock turtle drew a long breath END
START that is very curious END
START it is all about as curious as it can be END
START said the gryphon END
START it all came different END
START the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully END
START i should like to hear her try and repeat something now END
START tell her to begin END
START he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice END
START stand up and repeat â€˜tis the voice of the sluggard END
START said the gryphon END
START how the creatures order one about END
START and make one repeat lessons END
START i might as well be at school at once END
START she got up END
START and began to repeat it END
START but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille END
START that she hardly knew what she was saying END
START and the words came very queer indeed END
START tis the voice of the lobster END
START i heard him declare END
START you have baked me too brown END
START i must sugar my hair END
START as a duck with its eyelids END
START so he with his nose END
START trims his belt and his buttons END
START and turns out his toes END
START [later editions continued as follows END
START when the sands are all dry END
START he is gay as a lark END
START and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark END
START when the tide rises and sharks are around END
START his voice has a timid and tremulous sound END
START that is different from what i used to say when i was a child END
START said the gryphon END
START i never heard it before END
START said the mock turtle END
START but it sounds uncommon nonsense END
START alice said nothing END
START she had sat down with her face in her hands END
START wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again END
START i should like to have it explained END
START said the mock turtle END
START she cannot explain it END
START said the gryphon hastily END
START go on with the next verse END
START but about his toes END
START the mock turtle persisted END
START how could he turn them out with his nose END
START it is the first position in dancing END
START but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing END
START and longed to change the subject END
START go on with the next verse END
START the gryphon repeated impatiently END
START it begins â€˜i passed by his garden END
START alice did not dare to disobey END
START though she felt sure it would all come wrong END
START and she went on in a trembling voice END
START i passed by his garden END
START with one eye END
START how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie END
START [later editions continued as follows END
START the panther took pie-crust END
START while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat END
START when the pie was all finished END
START as a boon END
START was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon END
START while the panther received knife and fork with a growl END
START and concluded the banquet END
START what is the use of repeating all that stuff END
START the mock turtle interrupted END
START if you do not explain it as you go on END
START it is by far the most confusing thing i ever heard END
START i think you would better leave off END
START said the gryphon END
START and alice was only too glad to do so END
START shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille END
START the gryphon went on END
START or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song END
START if the mock turtle would be so kind END
START so eagerly that the gryphon said END
START in a rather offended tone END
START no accounting for tastes END
START sing her â€˜turtle soup END
START the mock turtle sighed deeply END
START in a voice sometimes choked with sobs END
START to sing this END
START so rich and green END
START waiting in a hot tureen END
START who for such dainties would not stoop END
START soup of the evening END
START soup of the evening END
START oop of the e END
START who cares for fish END
START or any other dish END
START who would not give all else for two p END
START ennyworth only of beautiful soup END
START pennyworth only of beautiful soup END
START oop of the e END
START cried the gryphon END
START and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it END
START when a cry of END
START the trials beginning END
START was heard in the distance END
START cried the gryphon END
START taking alice by the hand END
START it hurried off END
START without waiting for the end of the song END
START what trial is it END
START alice panted as she ran END
START but the gryphon only answered END
START and ran the faster END
START while more and more faintly came END
START carried on the breeze that followed them END
START the melancholy words END
START oop of the e END
START the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived END
START with a great crowd assembled about them END
START all sorts of little birds and beasts END
START as well as the whole pack of cards END
START the knave was standing before them END
START with a soldier on each side to guard him END
START and near the king was the white rabbit END
START with a trumpet in one hand END
START and a scroll of parchment in the other END
START in the very middle of the court was a table END
START with a large dish of tarts upon it END
START they looked so good END
START that it made alice quite hungry to look at them END
START i wish they would get the trial done END
START and hand round the refreshments END
START but there seemed to be no chance of this END
START so she began looking at everything about her END
START to pass away the time END
START alice had never been in a court of justice before END
START but she had read about them in books END
START and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there END
START that is the judge END
START she said to herself END
START because of his great wig END
START by the way END
START was the king END
START and as he wore his crown over the wig END
START look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it END
START he did not look at all comfortable END
START and it was certainly not becoming END
START and that is the jury-box END
START and those twelve creatures END
START she was obliged to say END
START because some of them were animals END
START and some were birds END
START i suppose they are the jurors END
START she said this last word two or three times over to herself END
START being rather proud of it END
START for she thought END
START and rightly too END
START that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all END
START would have done just as well END
START the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates END
START what are they doing END
START alice whispered to the gryphon END
START they cannot have anything to put down yet END
START before the trials begun END
START they are putting down their names END
START the gryphon whispered in reply END
START for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial END
START alice began in a loud END
START but she stopped hastily END
START for the white rabbit cried out END
START silence in the court END
START and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round END
START to make out who was talking END
START alice could see END
START as well as if she were looking over their shoulders END
START that all the jurors were writing down END
START on their slates END
START and she could even make out that one of them did not know how to spell END
START and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him END
START a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over END
START one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked END
START this of course END
START alice could not stand END
START and she went round the court and got behind him END
START and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away END
START she did it so quickly that the poor little juror END
START it was bill END
START could not make out at all what had become of it END
START after hunting all about for it END
START he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day END
START and this was of very little use END
START as it left no mark on the slate END
START read the accusation END
START said the king END
START on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet END
START and then unrolled the parchment scroll END
START and read as follows END
START the queen of hearts END
START she made some tarts END
START all on a summer day END
START the knave of hearts END
START he stole those tarts END
START and took them quite away END
START consider your verdict END
START the king said to the jury END
START the rabbit hastily interrupted END
START there is a great deal to come before that END
START call the first witness END
START said the king END
START and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet END
START and called out END
START the first witness was the hatter END
START he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other END
START i beg pardon END
START for bringing these in END
START but i had not quite finished my tea when i was sent for END
START you ought to have finished END
START said the king END
START when did you begin END
START the hatter looked at the march hare END
START who had followed him into the court END
START arm-in-arm with the dormouse END
START fourteenth of march END
START i think it was END
START said the march hare END
START added the dormouse END
START write that down END
START the king said to the jury END
START and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates END
START and then added them up END
START and reduced the answer to shillings and pence END
START take off your hat END
START the king said to the hatter END
START it is not mine END
START said the hatter END
START the king exclaimed END
START turning to the jury END
START who instantly made a memorandum of the fact END
START i keep them to sell END
START the hatter added as an explanation END
START i have none of my own END
START i am a hatter END
START here the queen put on her spectacles END
START and began staring at the hatter END
START who turned pale and fidgeted END
START give your evidence END
START said the king END
START and do not be nervous END
START or i will have you executed on the spot END
START this did not seem to encourage the witness at all END
START he kept shifting from one foot to the other END
START looking uneasily at the queen END
START and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter END
START just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation END
START which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was END
START she was beginning to grow larger again END
START and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court END
START but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her END
START i wish you would not squeeze so END
START said the dormouse END
START who was sitting next to her END
START i can hardly breathe END
START i cannot help it END
START said alice very meekly END
START i am growing END
START you have no right to grow here END
START said the dormouse END
START do not talk nonsense END
START said alice more boldly END
START you know you are growing too END
START but i grow at a reasonable pace END
START said the dormouse END
START not in that ridiculous fashion END
START and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court END
START all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter END
START just as the dormouse crossed the court END
START she said to one of the officers of the court END
START bring me the list of the singers in the last concert END
START on which the wretched hatter trembled so END
START that he shook both his shoes off END
START give your evidence END
START the king repeated angrily END
START or i will have you executed END
START whether you are nervous or not END
START i am a poor man END
START the hatter began END
START in a trembling voice END
START and i had not begun my tea END
START not above a week or so END
START and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin END
START and the twinkling of the tea END
START the twinkling of the what END
START said the king END
START it began with the tea END
START the hatter replied END
START of course twinkling begins with a t END
START said the king sharply END
START do you take me for a dunce END
START i am a poor man END
START the hatter went on END
START and most things twinkled after that END
START only the march hare said END
START i did not END
START the march hare interrupted in a great hurry END
START said the hatter END
START i deny it END
START said the march hare END
START he denies it END
START said the king END
START leave out that part END
START at any rate END
START the dormouse said END
START the hatter went on END
START looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too END
START but the dormouse denied nothing END
START being fast asleep END
START continued the hatter END
START i cut some more bread-and-butter END
START but what did the dormouse say END
START one of the jury asked END
START that i cannot remember END
START said the hatter END
START you must remember END
START remarked the king END
START or i will have you executed END
START the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter END
START and went down on one knee END
START i am a poor man END
START you are a very poor speaker END
START said the king END
START here one of the guinea-pigs cheered END
START and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court END
START as that is rather a hard word END
START i will just explain to you how it was done END
START they had a large canvas bag END
START which tied up at the mouth with strings END
START into this they slipped the guinea-pig END
START and then sat upon it END
START i am glad i have seen that done END
START i have so often read in the newspapers END
START at the end of trials END
START there was some attempts at applause END
START which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court END
START and i never understood what it meant till now END
START if that is all you know about it END
START you may stand down END
START continued the king END
START i cannot go no lower END
START said the hatter END
START i am on the floor END
START as it is END
START then you may sit down END
START the king replied END
START here the other guinea-pig cheered END
START and was suppressed END
START that finished the guinea-pigs END
START now we shall get on better END
START i would rather finish my tea END
START said the hatter END
START with an anxious look at the queen END
START who was reading the list of singers END
START you may go END
START said the king END
START and the hatter hurriedly left the court END
START without even waiting to put his shoes on END
START and just take his head off outside END
START the queen added to one of the officers END
START but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door END
START call the next witness END
START said the king END
START the next witness was the duchesss cook END
START she carried the pepper-box in her hand END
START and alice guessed who it was END
START even before she got into the court END
START by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once END
START give your evidence END
START said the king END
START said the cook END
START the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit END
START who said in a low voice END
START your majesty must cross-examine this witness END
START if i must END
START the king said END
START with a melancholy air END
START after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight END
START he said in a deep voice END
START what are tarts made of END
START said the cook END
START said a sleepy voice behind her END
START collar that dormouse END
START the queen shrieked out END
START behead that dormouse END
START turn that dormouse out of court END
START off with his whiskers END
START for some minutes the whole court was in confusion END
START getting the dormouse turned out END
START by the time they had settled down again END
START the cook had disappeared END
START said the king END
START with an air of great relief END
START call the next witness END
START and he added in an undertone to the queen END
START you must cross-examine the next witness END
START it quite makes my forehead ache END
START alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list END
START feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like END
START for they have not got much evidence yet END
START she said to herself END
START imagine her surprise END
START when the white rabbit read out END
START at the top of his shrill little voice END
START quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes END
START and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt END
START upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below END
START and there they lay sprawling about END
START reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before END
START i beg your pardon END
START she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay END
START and began picking them up again as quickly as she could END
START for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head END
START and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box END
START or they would die END
START the trial cannot proceed END
START said the king in a very grave voice END
START until all the jurymen are back in their proper places END
START he repeated with great emphasis END
START looking hard at alice as he said so END
START alice looked at the jury-box END
START and saw that END
START in her haste END
START she had put the lizard in head downwards END
START and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way END
START being quite unable to move END
START she soon got it out again END
START and put it right END
START not that it signifies much END
START she said to herself END
START i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other END
START as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset END
START and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them END
START they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident END
START all except the lizard END
START who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open END
START gazing up into the roof of the court END
START what do you know about this business END
START the king said to alice END
START persisted the king END
START that is very important END
START the king said END
START turning to the jury END
START they were just beginning to write this down on their slates END
START when the white rabbit interrupted END
START your majesty means END
START he said in a very respectful tone END
START but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke END
START the king hastily said END
START and went on to himself in an undertone END
START as if he were trying which word sounded best END
START some of the jury wrote it down END
START alice could see this END
START as she was near enough to look over their slates END
START but it does not matter a bit END
START she thought to herself END
START at this moment the king END
START who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book END
START and read out from his book END
START all persons more than a mile high to leave the court END
START everybody looked at alice END
START i am not a mile high END
START said the king END
START nearly two miles high END
START added the queen END
START i shall not go END
START at any rate END
START that is not a regular rule END
START you invented it just now END
START it is the oldest rule in the book END
START said the king END
START then it ought to be number one END
START the king turned pale END
START and shut his note-book hastily END
START consider your verdict END
START he said to the jury END
START in a low END
START there is more evidence to come yet END
START please your majesty END
START said the white rabbit END
START jumping up in a great hurry END
START this paper has just been picked up END
START what is in it END
START said the queen END
START i have not opened it yet END
START said the white rabbit END
START but it seems to be a letter END
START written by the prisoner to END
START it must have been that END
START said the king END
START unless it was written to nobody END
START which is not usual END
START who is it directed to END
START said one of the jurymen END
START it is not directed at all END
START said the white rabbit END
START there is nothing written on the outside END
START he unfolded the paper as he spoke END
START it is not a letter END
START it is a set of verses END
START are they in the prisoners handwriting END
START asked another of the jurymen END
START they are not END
START said the white rabbit END
START and that is the queerest thing about it END
START the jury all looked puzzled END
START he must have imitated somebody elses hand END
START said the king END
START the jury all brightened up again END
START please your majesty END
START said the knave END
START i did not write it END
START and they cannot prove i did END
START there is no name signed at the end END
START if you did not sign it END
START said the king END
START that only makes the matter worse END
START you must have meant some mischief END
START or else you would have signed your name like an honest man END
START there was a general clapping of hands at this END
START it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day END
START that proves his guilt END
START said the queen END
START it proves nothing of the sort END
START you do not even know what they are about END
START said the king END
START the white rabbit put on his spectacles END
START where shall i begin END
START please your majesty END
START begin at the beginning END
START the king said gravely END
START and go on till you come to the end END
START these were the verses the white rabbit read END
START they told me you had been to her END
START and mentioned me to him END
START she gave me a good character END
START but said i could not swim END
START he sent them word i had not gone END
START we know it to be true END
START if she should push the matter on END
START what would become of you END
START i gave her one END
START they gave him two END
START you gave us three or more END
START they all returned from him to you END
START though they were mine before END
START if i or she should chance to be END
START involved in this affair END
START he trusts to you to set them free END
START exactly as we were END
START my notion was that you had been END
START before she had this fit END
START an obstacle that came between END
START do not let him know she liked them best END
START for this must ever be END
START kept from all the rest END
START between yourself and me END
START that is the most important piece of evidence we have heard yet END
START said the king END
START rubbing his hands END
START so now let the jury END
START if any one of them can explain it END
START she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she was not a bit afraid of interrupting him END
START i will give him sixpence END
START i do not believe there is an atom of meaning in it END
START the jury all wrote down on their slates END
START she does not believe there is an atom of meaning in it END
START but none of them attempted to explain the paper END
START if there is no meaning in it END
START said the king END
START that saves a world of trouble END
START as we need not try to find any END
START and yet i do not know END
START he went on END
START spreading out the verses on his knee END
START and looking at them with one eye END
START i seem to see some meaning in them END
START said i could not swim END
START you cannot swim END
START turning to the knave END
START the knave shook his head sadly END
START do i look like it END
START which he certainly did not END
START being made entirely of cardboard END
START said the king END
START and he went on muttering over the verses to himself END
START â€˜we know it to be true END
START that is the jury END
START â€˜i gave her one END
START they gave him two END
START that must be what he did with the tarts END
START it goes on â€˜they all returned from him to you END
START there they are END
START said the king triumphantly END
START pointing to the tarts on the table END
START nothing can be clearer than that END
START â€˜before she had this fit END
START you never had fits END
START he said to the queen END
START said the queen furiously END
START throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke END
START the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger END
START as he found it made no mark END
START but he now hastily began again END
START using the ink END
START that was trickling down his face END
START as long as it lasted END
START then the words do not fit you END
START said the king END
START looking round the court with a smile END
START there was a dead silence END
START it is a pun END
START the king added in an offended tone END
START and everybody laughed END
START let the jury consider their verdict END
START the king said END
START for about the twentieth time that day END
START said the queen END
START stuff and nonsense END
START said alice loudly END
START the idea of having the sentence first END
START hold your tongue END
START said the queen END
START i will not END
START off with her head END
START the queen shouted at the top of her voice END
START who cares for you END
START she had grown to her full size by this time END
START you are nothing but a pack of cards END
START at this the whole pack rose up into the air END
START and came flying down upon her END
START she gave a little scream END
START half of fright and half of anger END
START and tried to beat them off END
START and found herself lying on the bank END
START with her head in the lap of her sister END
START who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face END
START said her sister END
START what a long sleep you have had END
START i have had such a curious dream END
START and she told her sister END
START as well as she could remember them END
START all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about END
START and when she had finished END
START her sister kissed her END
START it was a curious dream END
START but now run in to your tea END
START it is getting late END
START so alice got up and ran off END
START thinking while she ran END
START as well she might END
START what a wonderful dream it had been END
START but her sister sat still just as she left her END
START leaning her head on her hand END
START watching the setting sun END
START and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures END
START till she too began dreaming after a fashion END
START and this was her dream END
START she dreamed of little alice herself END
START and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee END
START and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers END
START she could hear the very tones of her voice END
START and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes END
START and still as she listened END
START or seemed to listen END
START the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream END
START the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by END
START the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool END
START she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal END
START and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution END
START once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the duchesss knee END
START while plates and dishes crashed around it END
START once more the shriek of the gryphon END
START the squeaking of the lizards slate-pencil END
START and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs END
START filled the air END
START mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle END
START so she sat on END
START with closed eyes END
START and half believed herself in wonderland END
START though she knew she had but to open them again END
START and all would change to dull reality END
START the grass would be only rustling in the wind END
START and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds END
START the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells END
START and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy END
START and the sneeze of the baby END
START the shriek of the gryphon END
START and all the other queer noises END
START to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard END
START while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs END
START she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would END
START in the after-time END
START be herself a grown woman END
START and how she would keep END
START through all her riper years END
START the simple and loving heart of her childhood END
START and how she would gather about her other little children END
START and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale END
START perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago END
START and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows END
START and find a pleasure in all their simple joys END
START remembering her own child-life END
START and the happy summer days END
